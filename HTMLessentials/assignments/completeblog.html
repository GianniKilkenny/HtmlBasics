            Richmond, Ca and am currently studying Software Engineering at San
            Jose State.<br /><br />
            I am looking to currently learning to ins n outs of html and in 6 to
            12 months I am looking forward to try and land my first
            intership.<br /><br />

            the work and nothing will stop me from reaching my goals.

        <h3>Inspiration</h3>

        <p>
          I have had many inspirational figures throughout my life<br /><br />
          One of the most inpiring people throughout my youth was Kobe Bryant.
          <br /><br />
          He pushed me to become to become the best version of my self,<br /><br />
          and he also showed me what real work ethic lookd like. Here
          <br /><br />is a video of him spekaing directly about that.

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>
        I have had a couple different hobbies throughout my life and they come
        down to two things, sports and video games. Growing up I always played
        basketball and video games.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I've gotten older I gotten into MMA and trained for a couple months
        as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is a funny website I made ranking MMA Goats:
