            Hi my name is Gianni Kilkenny and I am 21yrs old and am from
            Richmond, Ca and am currently studying Software Engineering at San
            Jose State.<br /><br />
            I am looking to currently learning to ins n outs of html and in 6 to
            12 months I am looking forward to try and land my first
            intership.<br /><br />
            I know that this will be a long Journey but I am willing to put in
            the work and nothing will stop me from reaching my goals.
          </p>
